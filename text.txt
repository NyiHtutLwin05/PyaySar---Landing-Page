// Code Collaboration Guidelines

// 1. When working on code, ensure that code is merged in the "pages/Layout.jsx" section.

// 2. For mobile and tablet development, use Chakra UI's `useBreakpointValue` for simplicity. However, feel free to use any other method if preferred.

// Example:
//    const isResponsive = useBreakpointValue({ base: true, md: false, sm: false });

//3. Feel free to customize it further based on your team's specific needs
